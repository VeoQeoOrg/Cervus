## Overview

**Cervus** is a complete, self-hosted x86_64 operating system written entirely from scratch. Every component—from the bootloader and kernel through the C standard library, shell, text editor, and compiler—is included in this repository with no external dependencies, no Linux compatibility layer, and no busybox shortcuts.

The goal is to create a minimal but genuinely usable Unix-style environment that can:
- Boot from both BIOS and UEFI firmware
- Install onto a real disk drive
- Provide a working login shell and userland environment
- Compile and run C code directly on the system
- Serve as a transparent, auditable, end-to-end computing stack

Cervus represents a complete rethinking of what a modern OS can be: transparent, self-contained, and comprehensible from startup to shutdown.

---

## Key Philosophy

Cervus is built around four core principles:

### 🔍 **No Black Boxes**
Every layer—from the bare-metal `_start` symbol to user applications—lives in this repository. The entire stack comprises approximately 13,000 lines of kernel C code, a clearly-factored standard library, and focused userland utilities. The system can be read and understood from beginning to end.

### 🏛️ **Not a Linux Clone**
Cervus has its own kernel ABI, custom syscall numbers, and native C library. While it speaks POSIX idioms where they make sense, the system is not bound to Linux internals. There are no artificial `/proc` assumptions, no `clone()` flag chaos, and no dependency on glibc ABI compatibility.

### ⚙️ **Real Userland**
This is not "a kernel that prints hello." Cervus includes a functional shell with command history, an interactive text editor, a working C compiler, a real filesystem on a real disk, and a complete installer that produces a bootable, persistent system.

### 🚀 **One-Command Build**
The entire system builds with a single command: `./build run`. The build system is itself a C binary, checked into the repository. No complicated shell scripts, no make dependency hell, no external tools beyond standard gcc, nasm, and qemu.

### Design Principles

**One Function Per File:** libcervus is organized with a single function per `.c` file, improving discoverability and reducing coupling.

**Monolithic Kernel:** Single-address-space kernel design with direct hardware access, no microkernel overhead.

**Minimal Dependencies:** No external code except Limine bootloader; everything else is self-contained.

**Clear Separation:** Public API in sysroot headers, implementation in kernel and libcervus, applications in bin/ and apps/.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

**Hardware:**
- x86_64 processor with 64-bit long mode
- 512 MB minimum RAM (1 GB recommended)
- Disk storage for installation (2 GB minimum)
- BIOS or UEFI firmware

**Host Build Requirements:**
To build Cervus, you need a standard Linux development environment:

| Tool | Purpose | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `gcc` | C compiler | `sudo apt install gcc` (or equivalent) |
| `nasm` | Assembler | `sudo apt install nasm` |
| `ar` | Archiver (binutils) | Usually included with build-essential |
| `qemu-system-x86_64` | x86_64 emulator | `sudo apt install qemu-system-x86` |
| `xorriso` | ISO manipulation | `sudo apt install xorriso` |
| `mtools` | FAT utilities | `sudo apt install mtools` |
| `ForgeZero` | Modern build system (upcoming) | See installation guide below |

### Installing ForgeZero (Modern Build System)

Cervus is transitioning to **ForgeZero** — a modern, cutting-edge build orchestration system that provides superior build performance, better dependency management, and an enhanced developer experience. The project will completely migrate to ForgeZero in upcoming releases.

**ForgeZero GitHub:** [forgezero-cli/ForgeZero](https://github.com/forgezero-cli/forgezero)

ForgeZero is optional for current builds (the legacy C-based build system still works), but we recommend installing it for future compatibility and to experience the next generation of Cervus builds.

#### Installation Method 1: Using Go (Recommended for Developers)

If you have Go installed, install ForgeZero with a single command:

```bash
# Install ForgeZero
GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/forgezero-cli/ForgeZero/cmd/fz@main

# Add to PATH (add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for permanent change)
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin

# Verify installation
fz --version
```

#### Installation Method 2: Pre-built Binary (No Go Required)

If you prefer not to use Go, download a pre-built binary:

1. **Visit** [ForgeZero Releases](https://github.com/forgezero-cli/forgezero/releases)
2. **Download** the binary for your platform (Linux x86_64, macOS, Windows)
3. **Make it executable** and move to your PATH:

```bash
# After downloading the binary
chmod +x fz
sudo mv fz /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
fz --version
```

### Quick Start

#### On a Linux System:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VeoQeo/Cervus.git
cd Cervus

# 2. Build and run in QEMU (one command)
./build run

# 3. System boots and presents login prompt
# Log in with default credentials
```

#### Create Bootable USB (for real hardware):

```bash
# After building, the ISO is in build/cervus.iso
# Write to USB device (replace sdX with your device)
sudo dd if=build/cervus.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M && sync
```

#### Boot from Installation Disk:

```bash
# From running Cervus (in Live mode)
/apps/install-on-disk

# Follow prompts to:
#   1. Select target disk
#   2. Confirm destructive operation
#   3. Wait for installation to complete
#   4. Reboot into installed system
```

## Building from Source

### Modern Build System: ForgeZero

**Cervus is actively transitioning to ForgeZero**, a next-generation build system that will completely replace the current C-based build system in upcoming releases. ForgeZero offers:

- ⚡ **Superior Performance** — Optimized parallel builds with intelligent caching
- 📦 **Better Dependency Management** — Explicit dependency graphs and version management
- 🔧 **Enhanced Developer Experience** — Clear build output, better error messages
- 🚀 **Future-Ready** — Modern architecture designed for complex projects
- 📱 **Cross-Platform** — Seamless builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows

**Current Status:**
- ✅ ForgeZero already integrated and available for use
- 🚧 Current C-based build system still fully functional
- 📅 Complete migration planned for next major release

For now, both build systems work interchangeably. Developers can choose either the legacy `./build` command or ForgeZero-based builds.

### Build Commands

The `./build` script is your primary interface. It invokes the C-based build system:

```bash
./build help          # Show all available commands

./build               # Full build (kernel + userland)
./build run           # Build and launch in QEMU

./build iso           # Build bootable ISO only
./build kernel        # Build kernel only
./build userland      # Build userland utilities only
./build clean         # Remove all build artifacts
./build distclean     # Clean + remove downloads

./build run-gdb       # Run with GDB debugger attached
./build run-kvm       # Use KVM acceleration (Linux only)
./build run-usb       # Create USB image instead of ISO
```

### Custom Build Options

Edit `builder/build.c` to customize:
- Kernel compiler flags
- Optimization level
- Debug symbols
- Include paths
- Output directories

### Build Time

On a typical modern system:
- **Full build:** 30-60 seconds
- **Incremental rebuild:** 5-15 seconds
- **QEMU boot to shell:** 3-5 seconds

### Build System Architecture

**Current Build System (C-based):**

The current build system (`builder/build.c`) is a single C program that:
1. Compiles the kernel (C + ASM)
2. Compiles libcervus (C library)
3. Compiles userland utilities
4. Packages everything into an ISO
5. Optionally launches QEMU

No make, no shell scripts, no external dependencies beyond compiler toolchain.

**Upcoming: ForgeZero Migration**

The project is actively migrating to **ForgeZero** for the following benefits:
- Better handling of complex build dependencies
- Improved parallel build performance
- Cleaner, more maintainable build configuration
- Better error reporting and debugging
- Full cross-platform support

Developers can start using ForgeZero commands immediately after installation. More details on ForgeZero-based builds will be available in upcoming releases.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**"gcc: command not found"**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

**"nasm: command not found"**
```bash
sudo apt install nasm
```

**"fz: command not found" (ForgeZero)**
```bash
# Install ForgeZero using Go
GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/forgezero-cli/ForgeZero/cmd/fz@main
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin

# Or download pre-built binary from:
# https://github.com/forgezero-cli/forgezero/releases
```

**Build timeout or hangs**
- Check system resources: `free -h`, `df -h`
- Clear build cache: `./build clean`
- Rebuild: `./build`

### Runtime Issues

**System hangs on boot**
- Run with: `./build run-qemu -- -cpu host` for better CPU compatibility
- Check QEMU version: `qemu-system-x86_64 --version`

**Filesystem becomes read-only**
- Normal for live ISO (ramfs-based)
